# FractalGenerator
Quick project I hacked up in a couple weeks for my grade 12 CS class.

This is a work in progress and was quickly done in a couple of weeks hence some bad practice and inefficient code. 

Things to do:
<ol>
  <li>Convert graphics to image and then cache image so that we can resize instead of drawing new Fractal every zoom or shift change.</li>
  <li>Improve layout with some JGoodies</li>
  <li>Add more Fractal types</li>
</ol>
