# FractalGenerator
Quick project I hacked up in a couple weeks for my grade 12 CS class.

This is a work in progress and was quickly done in a couple of weeks hence some bad practice and inefficient code. 

Things to do:
<ol>
  <li> Clean up code, polish multithreading logic </li>
  <li>Performance enhancements</li>
  <li>Layout cleanup</li>
  <li>Add more Fractal types</li>
  <li>Fix bugs</li>
</ol>
